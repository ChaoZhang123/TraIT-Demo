# TraIT-Demo
The pilot research in integrating different modules in TraIT. For the time being, the research goes around the OMIC data and tranSMART. We are aiming at a solution to systematically retrieve the data from multiple raw data storage systems, which will be used in tranSMART and GALAXY. Hopefully, this scheme will be transferrable to other modules.
